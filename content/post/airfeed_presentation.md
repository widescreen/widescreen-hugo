[Aaron Stephenson](https://au.linkedin.com/in/aaronstephenson) gives a great talk at the Sydney Video Technology meetup on his new tvOS app [Airfeed](http://airfeed.tv/).  It's not quite what you'd call a broadcast grade recording (h/t to [@mattdelves](https://twitter.com/mattdelves) either way!) but definitely worth checking out.  Go tv!
